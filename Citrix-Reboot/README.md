XenReboot.v0.1.ps1 - XA/XD 7.x lacked a robust solution to automate restarts of power managed devices, so I spent a few days using Shaun Ritchie's Rolling Reboot Script (http://euc.consulting/blog/xendesktop-7-rolling-reboot-script/) as inspiration and created my own. Comments do a pretty good job of describing what it does.

XenReboot.v1.0.ps1 - After a farm had issues post reboot I ended up re-doing about 90% of the script to better report errors and attempt to resolve them as well.
