# Normalize

Since this environment did not have software package management of any kind, replacing or upgrading software became a manual process.

Automating away most of the work saved time in both training and implementation, and this process of upgrading different pieces of software at once became known as "normalization".

Many settings were contained in group policy objects when possible.

This one was intended to upgrade the Citrix client for access to a new farm, upgrade the single sign-on client, and add e-faxing software if necessary. File locations and server names have been scrubbed of identifying information.
